# Ramen Rating App

This app allows users to add new ramen dishes to a list, display their details, and rate them.

# Technologies used 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Add new ramen dishes with a name, restaurant, image, rating, and comment.
- Display all ramen images in a grid.
- Click on an image to view its details.

## Challenges
- Initially, the form submission wasn't working correctly. I fixed this by using `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the page from reloading.
- The displayed images were too large. I resolved this by adding CSS to control their size.
